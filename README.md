# CS-230
A repository of my work completed for my CS 230: Operating Platforms class taught by Professor Fredericks.

The file included is a software design document filled out with analyses, comparisons, and recommendations for a fictional software "Draw It or Lose It."

The Gaming Room is the client that has requested a re-vamp of their Draw It or Lose It software to run on web-based platforms in an effort to
more vastly reach consumers.  I believe I analyzed the different operating platforms' strengths and weaknesses regarding this mindset very well.
At least, I sure hope so.
The process of working through a design document really helps lay out the finer details necessary to understand *why* you are scripting something
particular within your code.  I enjoyed that added perspective very much.
I would probably better the recommendations section as I feel like I could've delved much deeper into the analyses there.
The most important part of all of this is including the user in some way, shape, and form.  The reason why is because you are developing *for*
the user, and so including the user peppers in their perspective, and this perspective is very important in scripting something that will be readily accepted let alone enjoyed repeatedly.
I approached designing software with a very inquisitive and questioning mindset.  Doing it in this fashion, for me, allowed me to question aspects that I copmleted or accomplished, but not in a negative way; I questioned them in a way that allowed me to flourish on what I had already done and to delve further into the finer details of the respective aspect.
